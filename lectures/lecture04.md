## Quiz
- Concepts from first four lectures 

## Previous Homework
- Everyone should have SSH keys setup along with forks
- Everyone should have placed notes on learning experience and screenshot of app in the `.md` file
- Everyone should have made a Pull Request to only your OWN repo fork - not class one.
